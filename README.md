# wmp-endfbvii.1
This is the updated version of WMP library designed for ENDF/B-VII.1 neutron data files, which was generated by Vector Fitting instead of WHOPPER code. 
The residues and fitted polynomial coefficients only include elastic scattering (MT=2), absorption (MT=27), capture (MT=102) and/or fission (MT=18). Therfore, capture is calcualted by the substraction of absorption to fission.
